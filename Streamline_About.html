  		<h1>What Exactly Is <span id="company" class="animate fadeInUp one">Streamline</span>?</h1>
  		<hr>
  		<p>Streamline is an online service that eliminates the confusion of hospital billing by providing patients with a central location to pay bills. We were inspired to create Streamline in December 2016 after one of our cofounders had a surgery and received several bills for a single event. Trips to the hospital for chemotherapy treatments, pre- and post-natal care, or an open-heart surgery can lead to several bills from different departments and providers. Streamline allows patients to receive a single bill for each hospital visit, contest charges, and even create a payment plan using a payment plan calculator. Our service makes it easier for patients to manage their bills and focus on their health.</p>

  		<h1>The <span id="current">Current State of Hospital Billing</span> In The United States</h1>
  		<hr>
  		<p>Imagine you and your family go out for dinner on a Friday night. You have a lovely evening and great food, but the  me has come to pay the bill. The restaurant gives you a separate bill for the appetizer, a bill for the bread, a bill for the individual entrees, and a separate bill for the drinks. Afer that, you get a bill for eating at the restaurant, a bill from the waiter, and a separate bill from the chef. Even though it seems ridiculous, this is exactly how billing currently works in our healthcare system in the United States. For example, a patient is taken into the emergency room and needs an appendectomy. Afer the surgery is complete, the patient receives several bills including a bill from the surgeon, the pathology lab, the anesthesiologist, the emergency room doctor, the consulting doctor, and from the hospital. It is easy for one to very quickly become confused and overwhelmed by the number of bills coming from a single experience.</p>
